                text-align: justify;"> In "Long Live the Web" Tim Berners-Lee preaches that the internet must remain uncensored 
                if it is to remain for the people -- no caveats, no exceptions. This struck me as very <a href="Kant.html">Kantian</a>
                in its rigidity. If the internet is to remain an open resource for the people, should we not 
                try to eliminate hate speech? What about misinformation? I understand the concept that 
                people to some extent must figure out what they believe for themselves -- and to do so 
                must be exposed to a variety of information and media -- but particularly in an era of 
                unchecked AI and social unrest it feels like <i>something</i> must be done. In response
                to this, I think the Mozilla Manifesto advocates for a respectful and productive environment. 
                However, I noticed there wasn't really an action plan even though there is obviously a problem. 
                I get it -- it's difficult, I make no claim to have concrete ideas or solutions, but to improve 
                we must start somewhere.
