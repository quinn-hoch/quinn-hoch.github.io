    <h2>Idea 1: Spotify Wrapped</h2>
    <p> - Using Spotify API to create a version of Spotify wrapped that you can use 
      at any point in the year
   <br><br> -  pick a start date and an end date and how many artists you would like to see
   <br> <br>- kinda a bummer that Spotify Wrapped is a once a year thing (control as the consumer)</p>

    <h2>Idea 2: Restaurant to Recipe Generator</h2>
    <p> - Pick a restaurant and this site will generate a recipe that emulates
      that restaurant's menu
    <br> <br>
  - Could include dietary restrictions
<br><br>
- Could do multiple restaurants
<br> --- multiple recipes</p>

    <h2>Idea 3: Turning a Comic I Made into a Website</h2>
    <p> - I recently made this comic where there are several storylines going on at once
      and it could be fun to translate that into a digital experience
    <br> <br>
  - clicking different next buttons, hidden buttons, interactive elements
