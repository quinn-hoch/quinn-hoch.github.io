        <h1>Dear Dow Jones Hiring Team,</h1>
        <p>
        I’m writing to express my interest in the Product Design Intern position 
        at the New York base of Dow Jones. As an Integrated Design Media major at 
        NYU, one of my primary focuses is user experience and user interface design, 
        as well as user engagement through graphic media. My experience utilizing 
        Adobe Creative Suite to design interactive interfaces as well as optimize 
        psychosocial interaction provides me with an excellent technical foundation 
        to work with your team. 
        <br>
        <br>In the past, I have worked as an intern at several nonprofits developing
         and reshaping social media presence. Most recently, my work has included 
         developing a coordinated social media posting schedule to distribute images 
         and information across the country, organizing upwards of 10 social media 
         panels a week, as well as assisting in creating a consistent media presence 
         via Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.  
    <br>
    <br>
       In addition to this, I have also worked on multiple album release campaigns
        for independent artists designing cover art, interactive media elements to 
        boost engagement, as well as strict but realistic timelines to optimize 
        success. A major part of this was researching market norms and trends to 
        promote our product in the most effective way possible.
        <br>
      <br>
        Beyond my technical skills, I also understand that collaboration is integral
         to Dow Jones's working environment. As a Media Intern at an NYU affiliate, 
         I was recently part of an initiative to restructure our media presence to 
         heighten engagement, which we successfully accomplished. My role in this 
         process was to ensure smooth communication between several school departments,
          brainstorming with organization leaders, iterating projects across several 
          platforms, and maintaining consistent, open connection with all parties to 
          streamline progress. My experience in communication — a foundational aspect 
          to collaboration — and working with a large group of diverse people gives me 
          the insight and adaptability — in addition to my technical skills — to be an 
          asset to your team.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would love the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm 
        can be an asset to your team at Dow Jones. Thank you for your time 
        and consideration. 
        </p>
        <h2>Sincerely, <br><i>Quinn Hochglaube</i></h2>
