        <h1>Quinn's Take on John Berger</h1>
        <div class="frametext">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            I had seen a lot of these videos before, but not the second episode in which 
            Berger discusses the perception and experience of women, and I
            really loved it. I appreciated how he didn't just spout what he thought women
            might think as a man, but included a panel of women to validate his beliefs—here
            is <i>why</i> women feel objectified, the systemic building of a society with certain
            focuses, and here is the proof that women do indeed feel this way—they'll articulate 
            it themselves. Yet, this type of all-consumption is not limited to women. In 
            advertising, we are driven to compare ourselves and our experiences to whatever it
            is we are viewing. To take a picture—buy or have a picture or painting or photo or 
            reproduction—is to own some small part of it; to claim it as one's own. 
            To own something is to be envied-or at least, to seek to be envied. 
            And, to be envied is to be in the ultimate sense of the word, "glamourous". If there
            is one thing to take from Berger, it is the constant state of persuing "glamour"
            that we all inhabit. As Berger states—we cannot live without it.
