        <h1>Dear SeatGeek UX Design Team,</h1>
        <p>
        I’m writing to express my interest in the UX Design Intern position at 
        the New York base of SeatGeek. As an Integrated Design Media major, one 
        of my primary focuses is user experience and user interface design, as well as 
        user engagement through graphic media. My experience in class designing 
        interactive interfaces and creating sites using coding languages like
        Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, among others provides an excellent 
        technical foundation to work cross-functionally with 
        engineers and product managers while keeping the customer in mind. 
        
        <br>
        <br>Beyond my technical skills, I also understand that collaboration — and 
        therefore learning, curiosity, and engagement — are integral to SeatGeek’s 
        working environment. As a Media Intern at NYU Hillel, I was recently part of 
        an initiative to restructure our media presence to heighten engagement, which
        we successfully accomplished. My role in this process was to ensure smooth 
        communication between several school departments, brainstorming with organization 
        leaders, iterating projects, and maintaining consistent, open connection with all 
        parties to streamline progress. My experience in communication — a foundational aspect
        to collaboration — and working with a large group of diverese people with diverse 
        needs gives me the insight and adaptability to be an asset to your team. 
    <br>
    <br>
        On a personal level, I’m a huge fan of live entertainment and understand 
        the value behind providing customers with an intuitive, accessible, and 
        overall pleasant experience. As an Ambassador at Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams 
        I worked within a team to prioritize the customer experience, 
        engaging with coworkers and customers, and cultivating a passionate, 
        people-focused environment in a fast-paced setting. 
<br>
<br>
        I would love the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm 
        can be an asset to your team and look forward to the possibility of 
        working with you at SeatGeek. Thank you so much for your time and consideration. 
        </p>
        <h2>Sincerely, <br><i>Quinn Hochglaube</i></h2>
