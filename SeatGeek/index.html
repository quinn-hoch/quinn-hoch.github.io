        <h1>Dear SeatGeek UX Design Team,</h1>
        <p>
        I’m writing to express my interest in the UX Design Intern position at 
        the New York base of SeatGeek. As an Integrated Design Media major at NYU, one 
        of my primary focuses is user experience and user interface design, as well as 
        user engagement through graphic media. My experience in class designing 
        interactive interfaces and creating sites using coding languages like
        Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, among others provides an excellent 
        technical foundation to work cross-functionally with 
        engineers and product managers. 
        
        <br>
        <br>Beyond my technical skills, I also understand that collaboration is integral to SeatGeek’s 
        working environment. As a Media Intern at an NYU affiliate, I was recently part of 
        an initiative to restructure our media presence to heighten engagement, which
        we successfully accomplished. My role in this process was to ensure smooth 
        communication between several school departments, brainstorming with organization 
        leaders, iterating projects, and maintaining consistent, open connection with all 
        parties to streamline progress. My experience in communication — a foundational aspect
        to collaboration — and working with a large group of diverse people gives me the insight 
        and adaptability to be an asset to your team. 
    <br>
    <br>
        On a personal level, I’m a huge fan of live entertainment and understand 
        the value behind providing customers with an intuitive, accessible, and 
        wholly enjoyable experience. As an Ambassador at Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams 
        I worked within a team to prioritize the customer experience, 
        engaging with coworkers and customers, and cultivating a passionate, 
        people-focused environment in a fast-paced setting. 
<br>
<br>
        I would love the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm 
        can be an asset to your team at SeatGeek. Thank you for your time 
        and consideration. 
        </p>
        <h2>Sincerely, <br><i>Quinn Hochglaube</i></h2>
